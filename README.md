This is my first attempt at a Reddit Bot.

The goal is to detect chat/internet acronyms as defined on either webopedia.com or netlingo.com and write a comment explaining what they mean.

Let it be known that on December 24th, 2016, this bot was let loose for 2 minutes before I had added sleep time to the loop
where it replies to comments. Needless to say, the ~400 comment replies going out in <2 minutes were not received well, and 
the bot is dead forever.

RIP acronymbot
